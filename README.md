# Class Project: PacMen Exercise
**Description:** When the user clicks the "add pacmen" button a new pacman will be generated on the screen at a random location. When the user clicks the "start game" button the pacmen will start to move across the screen bouncing in a new direction when they hit the edge of the screen.

**How to Run:** Just load the HTML file into a web browser and then add as many pacmen as you would like to see on your screen. After that you can start game. 

**Roadmap of Future Improvements:** None at this time.
